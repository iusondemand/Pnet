# Pnet
Network configuration - windows 11

This script is just a working concept.

I need a command to get all relevant infos from my actual network status.

Ip, dns, vpn, tracerout, and so one. 

Just a tool to list all main infos. 

This is v1.1: it is not complete, but does the work I need until today.

Traceroute tracks route to my website cyberkit.it

Fork and update :)

V.S.
